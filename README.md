Greetings!

Welcome to the "Leaflet-Challenge" repository. This challenge utilized JSON/geoJSON data published by the U.S. Geological Survery (USGS) to visualize registered earthquakes for the past 7 days. The visualization uses HTML, JavaScript and CSS for page rendering. The Repository structure is listed below:

---'index.html': html file utilizing .js/.css files for page generation

---'static': Repository containing two directories ('js' and 'css') which contian the main JavaScript and CSS code for rendering ('style.css' and 'logic.js')

Cheers!
